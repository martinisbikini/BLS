ah yes sorry i forgot about that! here's what I use, it's in python. does a very basic background interpolation and then spits out the fit parameters for a Lorentzian to the sixth power model. You'll want the "BLS_L6fit_interp" function. It takes a frequency vector, normalized intensity, lower index for the interpolation, upper index for the interpolation, peak frequency, width in GHz, and the type of interpolation. sorry it's a little messy, but we can take a look together tomorrow if you like. the basic idea is it masks out the peak from sig_li to sig_ui, interpolates the background, takes that out, and then fits the peak to an L^6 function. I use the lmfit package and scipy.interpolate, but you could probably just use curve_fit from scipy too
